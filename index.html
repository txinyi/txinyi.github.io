                <h1>Hello, I'm Xinyi!</h1>
               I am passionate in Technology especially in the areas of Security and Software Engineering. 
               My dream is to become a Solutions Architecture as well as an Innovator, to create something out of nothing. 
               Furthermore, I am also keen to learn and understand Security, be it online or offline. 
               During leisure, I like to surf nets to pick up new skills, read books for self-enhancement and play League of Legends for entertainment. <br /></div>

        <h1>Recent Memorable Trip</h1>
        <p id="whitebox">Went to Korea on March 2015 for the last Study Trip before graduation. 
            It was the start of the spring where the weather is very chilly. 
            The temperature can go down to 3 degrees Celsius at night. 
            It was my first time traveling to the cool country and I super love and enjoy the weather there. 
            The tour guide is very friendly and funny, he brought us to eat the local delicacies, visit local hot places, EverLand and IT companies such as Samsung. 
            What I love the most about the trip is that we venture out at night(12am onwards) to explore the places and alley. 
            Even though we are foreign to the places, it is thrilling to walk around without knowing our ways back and contact with others. So fun!</p>
